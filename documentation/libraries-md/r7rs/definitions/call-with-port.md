#### Description

> ````
> (call-with-port port proc)
> ````
> 
> 
> **Domain**:  It is an error if `proc` does not accept one argument.
> 
> The `call-with-port`
> procedure calls `proc` with `port` as an argument.
> If `proc` returns,
> then the port is closed automatically and the values yielded by the
> `proc` are returned.  If `proc` does not return, then
> the port must not be closed automatically unless it is possible to
> prove that the port will never again be used for a read or write
> operation.
> 
> **Rationale**:  Because Scheme's escape procedures have unlimited extent, it  is
> possible to escape from the current continuation but later to resume it.
> If implementations were permitted to close the port on any escape from the
> current continuation, then it would be impossible to write portable code using
> both `call-with-current-continuation` and `call-with-port`.
