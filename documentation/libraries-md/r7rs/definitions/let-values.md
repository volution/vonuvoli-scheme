#### Description

> ````
> (let-values <mv-binding-spec> <body>)
> ````
> 
> 
> **Syntax**:
> `<Mv-binding-spec>` has the form
> ````
> ((<formals_1> <init_1>) ...)
> ````
> 
> where each `<init>` is an expression, and `<body>` is
> zero or more definitions followed by a sequence of one or
> more expressions as described in section on `lambda`.  It is an error for a variable to appear more than
> once in the set of `<formals>`.
> 
> **Semantics**:
> The `<init>`s are evaluated in the current environment (in some
> unspecified order) as if by invoking `call-with-values`, and the
> variables occurring in the `<formals>` are bound to fresh locations
> holding the values returned by the `<init>`s, where the
> `<formals>` are matched to the return values in the same way that
> the `<formals>` in a `lambda` expression are matched to the
> arguments in a procedure call.  Then, the `<body>` is evaluated in
> the extended environment, and the values of the last expression of
> `<body>` are returned.  Each binding of a `<variable>` has
> `<body>` as its region.
> 
> It is an error if the `<formals>` do not match the number of
> values returned by the corresponding `<init>`.
