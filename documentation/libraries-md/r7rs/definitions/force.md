#### Description

> ````
> (force promise)
> ````
> 
> 
> The `force` procedure forces the value of a `promise` created
> by `delay`, `delay-force`, or `make-promise`.
> If no value has been computed for the promise, then a value is
> computed and returned.  The value of the promise must be cached (or
> "memoized") so that if it is forced a second time, the previously
> computed value is returned.
> Consequently, a delayed expression is evaluated using the parameter
> values and exception handler of the call to `force` which first
> requested its value.
> If `promise` is not a promise, it may be returned unchanged.
>

> The following example is a mechanical transformation of a lazy
> stream-filtering algorithm into Scheme.  Each call to a constructor is
> wrapped in `delay`, and each argument passed to a deconstructor is
> wrapped in `force`.  The use of `(delay-force ...)` instead of
> `(delay (force ...))` around the body of the procedure ensures that an
> ever-growing sequence of pending promises does not
> exhaust available storage,
> because `force` will in effect force such sequences iteratively.

> Various extensions to this semantics of `delay`, `force` and

> 
>   * Calling `force` on an object that is not a promise may simply
> return the object.
> 
>   * It may be the case that there is no means by which a promise can be
> operationally distinguished from its forced value.  That is, expressions
> like the following may evaluate to either `#t` or to `#f`,
> depending on the implementation:
> 
> ````
> (eqv? (delay 1) 1)          ===>  #unspecified
> (pair? (delay (cons 1 2)))  ===>  #unspecified
> ````
> 
>   * Implementations may implement "implicit forcing", where
> the value of a promise is forced by procedures
> that operate only on arguments of a certain type, like `cdr`
> and `*`.  However, procedures that operate uniformly on their
> arguments, like `list`, must not force them.
