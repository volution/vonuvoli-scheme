#### Description

> ````
> (letrec* <bindings> <body>)
> ````
> 
> 
> **Syntax**:
> `<Bindings>` has the form
> ````
> ((<variable_1> <init_1>) ...)
> ````
> and `<body>` is a sequence of
> zero or more definitions followed by
> one or more expressions as described in section on `lambda`. It is an error for a `<variable>` to appear more
> than once in the list of variables being bound.
> 
> **Semantics**:
> The `<variable>`s are bound to fresh locations,
> each `<variable>` is assigned in left-to-right order to the
> result of evaluating the corresponding `<init>`, the `<body>` is
> evaluated in the resulting environment, and the values of the last
> expression in `<body>` are returned.
> Despite the left-to-right evaluation and assignment order, each binding of
> a `<variable>` has the entire `letrec*` expression as its
> region, making it possible to define mutually recursive
> procedures.
> 
> If it is not possible to evaluate each `<init>` without assigning or
> referring to the value of the corresponding `<variable>` or the
> `<variable>` of any of the bindings that follow it in
> `<bindings>`, it is an error.
> Another restriction is that it is an error to invoke the continuation
> of an `<init>` more than once.
