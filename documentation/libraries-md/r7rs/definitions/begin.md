#### Description

> ````
> (begin <expression-or-definition> ...)
> ````
> 
> 
> This form of `begin` can appear as part of a `<body>`, or at the
> outermost level of a `<program>`, or at the REPL, or directly nested
> in a `begin` that is itself of this form.
> It causes the contained expressions and definitions to be evaluated
> exactly as if the enclosing `begin` construct were not present.
> 
> **Rationale**:
> This form is commonly used in the output of
> macros (see section on macros)
> which need to generate multiple definitions and
> splice them into the context in which they are expanded.

> This form of `begin` can be used as an ordinary expression.
> The `<expression>`s are evaluated sequentially from left to right,
> and the values of the last `<expression>` are returned. This
> expression type is used to sequence side effects such as assignments
> or input and output.
