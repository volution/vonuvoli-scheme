#### Description

> ````
> (current-jiffy)
> ````
> 
> 
> Returns the number of __jiffies__ as an exact integer that have elapsed since an arbitrary,
> implementation-defined epoch. A jiffy is an implementation-defined
> fraction of a second which is defined by the return value of the
> `jiffies-per-second` procedure. The starting epoch is guaranteed to be
> constant during a run of the program, but may vary between runs.
> 
> **Rationale**:  Jiffies are allowed to be implementation-dependent so that
> `current-jiffy` can execute with minimum overhead. It
> should be very likely that a compactly represented integer will suffice
> as the returned value.  Any particular jiffy size will be inappropriate
> for some implementations: a microsecond is too long for a very fast
> machine, while a much smaller unit would force many implementations to
> return integers which have to be allocated for most calls, rendering
> `current-jiffy` less useful for accurate timing measurements.
