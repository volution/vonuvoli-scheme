#### Description

> ````
> (call-with-values producer consumer)
> ````
> 
> 
> Calls its `producer` argument with no arguments and
> a continuation that, when passed some values, calls the
> `consumer` procedure with those values as arguments.
> The continuation for the call to `consumer` is the
> continuation of the call to `call-with-values`.
