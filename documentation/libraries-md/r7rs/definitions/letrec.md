#### Description

> ````
> (letrec <bindings> <body>)
> ````
> 
> 
> **Syntax**:
> `<Bindings>` has the form
> ````
> ((<variable_1> <init_1>) ...)
> ````
> and `<body>` is a sequence of
> zero or more definitions followed by
> one or more expressions as described in section on `lambda`. It is an error for a `<variable>` to appear more
> than once in the list of variables being bound.
> 
> **Semantics**:
> The `<variable>`s are bound to fresh locations holding unspecified
> values, the `<init>`s are evaluated in the resulting environment (in
> some unspecified order), each `<variable>` is assigned to the result
> of the corresponding `<init>`, the `<body>` is evaluated in the
> resulting environment, and the values of the last expression in
> `<body>` are returned.  Each binding of a `<variable>` has the
> entire `letrec` expression as its region, making it possible to
> define mutually recursive procedures.
> 
> ````
> (letrec ((even?
>           (lambda (n)
>             (if (zero? n)
>                 #t
>                 (odd? (- n 1)))))
>          (odd?
>           (lambda (n)
>             (if (zero? n)
>                 #f
>                 (even? (- n 1))))))
>   (even? 88))
>                 ===>  #t
> ````
> 
> One restriction on `letrec` is very important: if it is not possible
> to evaluate each `<init>` without assigning or referring to the value of any
> `<variable>`, it is an error.  The
> restriction is necessary because
> `letrec` is defined in terms of a procedure
> call where a `lambda` expression binds the `<variable>`s to the values
> of the `<init>`s.
> In the most common uses of `letrec`, all the `<init>`s are
> `lambda` expressions and the restriction is satisfied automatically.
