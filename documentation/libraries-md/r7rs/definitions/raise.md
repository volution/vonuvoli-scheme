#### Description

> ````
> (raise obj)
> ````
> 
> 
> Raises an exception by invoking the current exception
> handler on `obj`. The handler is called with the same
> dynamic environment as that of the call to `raise`, except that
> the current exception handler is the one that was in place when the
> handler being called was installed.  If the handler returns, a secondary
> exception is raised in the same dynamic environment as the handler.
> The relationship between `obj` and the object raised by
> the secondary exception is unspecified.
