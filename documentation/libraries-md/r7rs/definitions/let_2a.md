#### Description

> ````
> (let* <bindings> <body>)
> ````
> 
> 
> **Syntax**:
> `<Bindings>` has the form
> ````
> ((<variable_1> <init_1>) ...)
> ````
> and `<body>` is a sequence of
> zero or more definitions followed by
> one or more expressions as described in section on `lambda`.
> 
> **Semantics**:
> The `let*` binding construct is similar to `let`, but the bindings are performed
> sequentially from left to right, and the region of a binding indicated
> by `(<variable> <init>)` is that part of the `let*`
> expression to the right of the binding.  Thus the second binding is done
> in an environment in which the first binding is visible, and so on.
> The `<variable>`s need not be distinct.
