#### Description

> ````
> (do ((<variable_1> <init_1> <step_1>)
>      ...)
>     (<test> <expression> ...)
>   <command> ...)
> ````
> 
> **Syntax**:
> All of `<init>`, `<step>`, `<test>`, and `<command>`
> are expressions.
> 
> **Semantics**:
> A `do` expression is an iteration construct.  It specifies a set of variables to
> be bound, how they are to be initialized at the start, and how they are
> to be updated on each iteration.  When a termination condition is met,
> the loop exits after evaluating the `<expression>`s.
> 
> A `do` expression is evaluated as follows:
> The `<init>` expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order),
> the `<variable>`s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
> `<init>` expressions are stored in the bindings of the
> `<variable>`s, and then the iteration phase begins.
> 
> Each iteration begins by evaluating `<test>`; if the result is
> false (see section on booleans), then the `<command>`
> expressions are evaluated in order for effect, the `<step>`
> expressions are evaluated in some unspecified order, the
> `<variable>`s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
> `<step>`s are stored in the bindings of the
> `<variable>`s, and the next iteration begins.
> 
> If `<test>` evaluates to a true value, then the
> `<expression>`s are evaluated from left to right and the values of
> the last `<expression>` are returned.  If no `<expression>`s
> are present, then the value of the `do` expression is unspecified.
> 
> The region of the binding of a `<variable>`
> consists of the entire `do` expression except for the `<init>`s.
> It is an error for a `<variable>` to appear more than once in the
> list of `do` variables.
> 
> A `<step>` can be omitted, in which case the effect is the
> same as if `(<variable> <init> <variable>)` had
> been written instead of `(<variable> <init>)`.
