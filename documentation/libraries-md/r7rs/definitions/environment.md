#### Description

> ````
> (environment list_1 ...)
> ````
> 
> 
> This procedure returns a specifier for the environment that results by
> starting with an empty environment and then importing each `list`,
> considered as an import set, into it.  (See section on libraries for
> a description of import sets.)  The bindings of the environment
> represented by the specifier are immutable, as is the environment itself.
