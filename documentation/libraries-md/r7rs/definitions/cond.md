#### Description

> ````
> (cond <clause_1> <clause_2> ...)
> else    ; auxiliary syntax
> =>      ; auxiliary syntax
> ````
> 
> 
> **Syntax**:
> `<Clauses>` take one of two forms, either
> ````
> (<test> <expression_1> ...)
> ````
> where `<test>` is any expression, or
> ````
> (<test> => <expression>)
> ````
> The last `<clause>` can be
> an "else clause", which has the form
> ````
> (else <expression_1> <expression_2> ...)
> ````
> 
> **Semantics**:
> A `cond` expression is evaluated by evaluating the `<test>`
> expressions of successive `<clause>`s in order until one of them
> evaluates to a true value (see
> section on booleans).  When a `<test>` evaluates to a true
> value, the remaining `<expression>`s in its `<clause>` are
> evaluated in order, and the results of the last `<expression>` in the
> `<clause>` are returned as the results of the entire `cond`
> expression.
> 
> If the selected `<clause>` contains only the
> `<test>` and no `<expression>`s, then the value of the
> `<test>` is returned as the result.  If the selected `<clause>` uses the
> `=>` alternate form, then the `<expression>` is evaluated.
> It is an error if its value is not a procedure that accepts one argument.  This procedure is then
> called on the value of the `<test>` and the values returned by this
> procedure are returned by the `cond` expression.
> 
> If all `<test>`s evaluate
> to `#f`, and there is no else clause, then the result of
> the conditional expression is unspecified; if there is an else
> clause, then its `<expression>`s are evaluated in order, and the values of
> the last one are returned.
