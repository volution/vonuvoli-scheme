#### Description

> ````
> (let <bindings> <body>)
> ````
> 
> 
> **Syntax**:
> `<Bindings>` has the form
> ````
> ((<variable_1> <init_1>) ...)
> ````
> where each `<init>` is an expression, and `<body>` is a
> sequence of zero or more definitions followed by a
> sequence of one or more expressions as described in section on `lambda`.  It is
> an error for a `<variable>` to appear more than once in the list of variables
> being bound.
> 
> **Semantics**:
> The `<init>`s are evaluated in the current environment (in some
> unspecified order), the `<variable>`s are bound to fresh locations
> holding the results, the `<body>` is evaluated in the extended
> environment, and the values of the last expression of `<body>`
> are returned.  Each binding of a `<variable>` has `<body>` as its
> region.

>   (let ((x 7)
>         (z (+ x y)))

> 
> 
> **Semantics**:
> "Named `let`" is a variant on the syntax of `let` which provides
> a more general looping construct than `do` and can also be used to express
> recursion.
> It has the same syntax and semantics as ordinary `let`
> except that `<variable>` is bound within `<body>` to a procedure
> whose formal arguments are the bound variables and whose body is
> `<body>`.  Thus the execution of `<body>` can be repeated by
> invoking the procedure named by `<variable>`.
