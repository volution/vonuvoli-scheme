<a id='definition__r7rs__peek-char__description'></a>

#### Description

> ````
> (peek-char)
> (peek-char port)
> ````
> 
> 
> Returns the next character available from the textual input `port`,
> but **without** updating
> the `port` to point to the following character.  If no more characters
> are available, an end-of-file object is returned.
> 
> **Note**:  The value returned by a call to `peek-char` is the same as the
> value that would have been returned by a call to `read-char` with the
> same `port`.  The only difference is that the very next call to
> `read-char` or `peek-char` on that `port` will return the
> value returned by the preceding call to `peek-char`.  In particular, a call
> to `peek-char` on an interactive port will hang waiting for input
> whenever a call to `read-char` would have hung.
