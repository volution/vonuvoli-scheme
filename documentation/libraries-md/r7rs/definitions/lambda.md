#### Description

> ````
> (lambda <formals> <body>)
> ````
> 
> **Syntax**:
> `<Formals>` is a formal arguments list as described below,
> and `<body>` is a sequence of zero or more definitions
> followed by one or more expressions.
> 
> **Semantics**:
> A `lambda` expression evaluates to a procedure.  The environment in
> effect when the `lambda` expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the
> procedure.  When the procedure is later called with some actual
> arguments, the environment in which the `lambda` expression was evaluated will
> be extended by binding the variables in the formal argument list to
> fresh locations, and the corresponding actual argument values will be stored
> in those locations.
> (A __fresh__ location is one that is distinct from every previously
> existing location.)
> Next, the expressions in the
> body of the lambda expression (which, if it contains definitions,
> represents a `letrec*` form, see section on `letrec*`)
> will be evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.
> The results of the last expression in the body will be returned as
> the results of the procedure call.

> 
> `<Formals>` have one of the following forms:
> 
>   * `(variable_1 ...)`:
> The procedure takes a fixed number of arguments; when the procedure is
> called, the arguments will be stored in fresh locations
> that are bound to the corresponding variables.
> 
>   * `<variable>`:
> The procedure takes any number of arguments; when the procedure is
> called, the sequence of actual arguments is converted into a newly
> allocated list, and the list is stored in a fresh location
> that is bound to
> `<variable>`.
> 
>   * `(variable_1 ... <variable_n> . <variable_n+1>)`:
> If a space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then
> the procedure takes `n` or more arguments, where `n` is the
> number of formal arguments before the period (it is an error if there is not
> at least one).
> The value stored in the binding of the last variable will be a
> newly allocated
> list of the actual arguments left over after all the other actual
> arguments have been matched up against the other formal arguments.
> 
> It is an error for a `<variable>` to appear more than once in
> `<formals>`.

> Each procedure created as the result of evaluating a `lambda` expression is
> (conceptually) tagged
