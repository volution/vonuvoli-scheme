#### Description

> ##### Dynamic bindings
> 
> The __dynamic extent__ of a procedure call is the time between
> when it is initiated and when it returns.  In Scheme,
> `call-with-current-continuation` (section on control features) allows
> reentering a dynamic extent after its procedure call has returned.
> Thus, the dynamic extent of a call might not be a single, continuous time
> period.
> 
> This sections introduces __parameter objects__, which can be
> bound to new values for the duration of a dynamic extent.  The set of
> all parameter bindings at a given time is called the
> __dynamic environment__.
