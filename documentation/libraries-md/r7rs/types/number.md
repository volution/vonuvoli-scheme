#### Description

> It is important to distinguish between mathematical numbers, the
> Scheme numbers that attempt to model them, the machine representations
> used to implement the Scheme numbers, and notations used to write numbers.
> This report uses the types `number`, `complex`, `real`,
> `rational`, and `integer` to refer to both mathematical numbers
> and Scheme numbers.
> 
> 
> ##### Numerical types
> 
> Mathematically, numbers are arranged into a tower of subtypes
> in which each level is a subset of the level above it:
>   * number
>   * complex number
>   * real number
>   * rational number
>   * integer
> 
> For example, 3 is an integer.  Therefore 3 is also a rational,
> a real, and a complex number.  The same is true of the Scheme numbers
> that model 3.  For Scheme numbers, these types are defined by the
> predicates `number?`, `complex?`, `real?`, `rational?`,
> and `integer?`.
> 
> There is no simple relationship between a number's type and its
> representation inside a computer.  Although most implementations of
> Scheme will offer at least two different representations of 3, these
> different representations denote the same integer.
> 
> Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract data, as
> independent of their representation as possible.  Although an implementation
> of Scheme may use multiple internal representations of
> numbers, this ought not to be apparent to a casual programmer writing
> simple programs.
> 
> 
> ##### Exactness
> 
> It is useful to distinguish between numbers that are
> represented exactly and those that might not be.  For example, indexes
> into data structures must be known exactly, as must some polynomial
> coefficients in a symbolic algebra system.  On the other hand, the
> results of measurements are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers
> may be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approximations.
> In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
> required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.
> This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.
> 
> A Scheme number is
> `exact` if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from
> __exact__ numbers using only __exact__ operations.  A number is
> `inexact` if it was written as an inexact constant,
> if it was
> derived using __inexact__ ingredients, or if it was derived using
> __inexact__ operations. Thus __inexact__-ness is a contagious
> property of a number.
> 
> In particular, an __exact complex number__ has an exact real part
> and an exact imaginary part; all other complex numbers are
> __inexact complex numbers__.
> 
> If two implementations produce __exact__ results for a
> computation that did not involve __inexact__ intermediate results,
> the two ultimate results will be mathematically equal.  This is
> generally not true of computations involving __inexact__ numbers
> since approximate methods such as floating-point arithmetic may be used,
> but it is the duty of each implementation to make the result as close as
> practical to the mathematically ideal result.
> 
> Rational operations such as `+` should always produce
> __exact__ results when given __exact__ arguments.
> If the operation is unable to produce an __exact__ result,
> then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction
> or it may silently coerce its
> result to an __inexact__ value.
> However, `(/ 3 4)` must not return the mathematically incorrect value `0`.
> 
> Except for `exact`, the operations described in
> this section must generally return inexact results when given any inexact
> arguments.  An operation may, however, return an __exact__ result if it can
> prove that the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
> arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number by an __exact__ zero
> may produce an __exact__ zero result, even if the other argument is
> __inexact__.
> 
> Specifically, the expression `(* 0 +inf.0)` may return `0`,
> or `+nan.0`, or report that inexact numbers are not supported,
> or report that non-rational real numbers are not supported, or fail
> silently or noisily in other implementation-specific ways.
> 
> 
> ##### Implementation restrictions
> 
> Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the whole
> tower of subtypes given in the section "Numerical types",
> but they must implement a coherent subset consistent with both the
> purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language.
> For example, implementations in which all numbers are __real__,
> or in which non-__real__ numbers are always __inexact__,
> or in which __exact__ numbers are always __integer__,
> are still quite useful.
> 
> Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers of
> any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  The supported
> range for __exact__ numbers of any type may be different from the
> supported range for __inexact__ numbers of that type.  For example,
> an implementation that uses IEEE binary double-precision floating-point numbers to represent all its
> __inexact__ __real__ numbers may also
> support a practically unbounded range of __exact__ __integer__'s
> and __rational__'s
> while limiting the range of __inexact__ __real__'s (and therefore
> the range of __inexact__ __integer__'s and __rational__'s)
> to the dynamic range of the IEEE binary double format.
> Furthermore,
> the gaps between the representable __inexact__ __integer__'s and
> __rational__'s are
> likely to be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this
> range are approached.
> 
> An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers
> throughout the range of numbers permitted as indexes of
> lists, vectors, bytevectors, and strings or that result from computing the length of
> one of these.  The `length`, `vector-length`,
> `bytevector-length`, and `string-length` procedures must return an exact
> integer, and it is an error to use anything but an exact integer as an
> index.  Furthermore, any integer constant within the index range, if
> expressed by an exact integer syntax, must be read as an exact
> integer, regardless of any implementation restrictions that apply
> outside this range.  Finally, the procedures listed below will always
> return exact integer results provided all their arguments are exact integers
> and the mathematically expected results are representable as exact integers
> within the implementation:

> practically unlimited size and precision, and to implement the

> such a way that they always return __exact__ results when given __exact__
> arguments.  If one of these procedures is unable to deliver an __exact__
> result when given __exact__ arguments, then it may either report a
> violation of an
> implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an
> __inexact__ number; such a coercion can cause an error later.
> Nevertheless, implementations that do not provide __exact__ rational
> numbers should return __inexact__ rational numbers rather than
> reporting an implementation restriction.
> 
> An implementation may use floating-point and other approximate
> representation strategies for __inexact__ numbers.
> This report recommends, but does not require, that
> implementations that use
> floating-point representations
> follow the IEEE 754 standard,
> and that implementations using
> other representations should match or exceed the precision achievable
> using these floating-point standards.
> In particular, the description of transcendental functions in IEEE 754-2008
> should be followed by such implementations, particularly with respect
> to infinities and `NaN`s.
> 
> Although Scheme allows a variety of written
> notations for
> numbers, any particular implementation may support only some of them.
> For example, an implementation in which all numbers are __real__
> need not support the rectangular and polar notations for complex
> numbers.  If an implementation encounters an __exact__ numerical constant that
> it cannot represent as an __exact__ number, then it may either report a
> violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently represent the
> constant by an __inexact__ number.
> 
> 
> ##### Implementation extensions
> 
> Implementations may provide more than one representation of
> floating-point numbers with differing precisions.  In an implementation
> which does so, an inexact result must be represented with at least
> as much precision as is used to express any of the inexact arguments
> to that operation.  Although it is desirable for potentially inexact
> operations such as `sqrt` to produce __exact__ answers when
> applied to __exact__ arguments, if an __exact__ number is operated
> upon so as to produce an __inexact__ result, then the most precise
> representation available must be used.  For example, the value of
> `(sqrt 4)` should be `2`, but in an implementation that provides both
> single and double precision floating point numbers it may be the latter
> but must not be the former.
> 
> It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using inexact
> number objects with magnitude or significand too large to be
> represented in the implementation.
> 
> In addition, implementations may
> distinguish special numbers called __positive infinity__,
> __negative infinity__, __NaN__, and __negative zero__.
> 
> Positive infinity is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational)
> number that represents an indeterminate value greater than the
> numbers represented by all rational numbers. Negative infinity
> is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational) number that
> represents an indeterminate value less than the numbers represented
> by all rational numbers.
> 
> Adding or multiplying an infinite value by any finite real value results
> in an appropriately signed infinity; however, the sum of positive and
> negative infinities is a `NaN`.  Positive infinity is the reciprocal
> of zero, and negative infinity is the reciprocal of negative zero.
> The behavior of the transcendental functions is sensitive to infinity
> in accordance with IEEE 754.
> 
> A `NaN` is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational) number
> so indeterminate that it might represent any real value, including
> positive or negative infinity, and might even be greater than positive
> infinity or less than negative infinity.
> An implementation that does not support non-real numbers may use `NaN`
> to represent non-real values like `(sqrt -1.0)` and `(asin 2.0)`.
> 
> A `NaN` always compares false to any number, including a `NaN`.
> An arithmetic operation where one operand is `NaN` returns `NaN`, unless the
> implementation can prove that the result would be the same if the `NaN`
> were replaced by any rational number.  Dividing zero by zero results in
> `NaN` unless both zeros are exact.
> 
> IEEE 754 specifies multiple `NaN` values.  Scheme generally does
> not care if there is a single value (bit pattern) for `NaN`,
> or if there are multiple values: if there are multiple `NaN`
> values, or just one, they are all equivalent in terms of Scheme
> computation.
> 
> Negative zero is an inexact real value written `-0.0` and is distinct
> (in the sense of `eqv?`) from `0.0`.  A Scheme implementation
> is not required to distinguish negative zero.  If it does, however, the
> behavior of the transcendental functions is sensitive to the distinction
> in accordance with IEEE 754.
> Specifically, in a Scheme implementing both complex numbers and negative zero,
> the branch cut of the complex logarithm function is such that
> `(imag-part (log -1.0-0.0i))` is `-pi` rather than `pi`.
> 
> Furthermore, the negation of negative zero is ordinary zero and vice
> versa.  This implies that the sum of two or more negative zeros is negative,
> and the result of subtracting (positive) zero from a negative zero is
> likewise negative.  However, numerical comparisons treat negative zero
> as equal to zero.

> ##### Syntax of numerical constants
> 
> The syntax of the written representations for numbers is described formally in the
> section on formal syntax.  Note that case is not significant in numerical
> constants.
> 
> A number can be written in binary, octal, decimal, or
> hexa-decimal by the use of a radix prefix.  The radix prefixes are
> `#b` (binary), `#o` (octal),
> `#d` (decimal), and `#x` (hexa-decimal).  With
> no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be expressed in decimal.
> 
> A
> numerical constant can be specified to be either __exact__ or
> __inexact__ by a prefix.  The prefixes are `#e`
> for __exact__, and `#i` for __inexact__.  An exactness
> prefix can appear before or after any radix prefix that is used.  If
> the written representation of a number has no exactness prefix, the
> constant is
> __inexact__ if it contains a decimal point or an
> exponent.
> Otherwise, it is __exact__.
> 
> In systems with __inexact__ numbers
> of varying precisions it can be useful to specify
> the precision of a constant.  For this purpose,
> implementations may accept numerical constants
> written with an exponent marker that indicates the
> desired precision of the __inexact__
> representation.  If so, the letter `s`, `f`,
> `d`, or `l`, meaning __short__, __single__,
> __double__, or __long__ precision, respectively,
> can be used in place of `e`.
> The default precision has at least as much precision
> as __double__, but
> implementations may allow this default to be set by the user.
