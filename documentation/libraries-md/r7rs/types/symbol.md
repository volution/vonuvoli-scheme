#### Description

> Symbols are objects whose usefulness rests on the fact that two
> symbols are identical (in the sense of `eqv?`) if and only if their
> names are spelled the same way.  For instance, they can be used
> the way enumerated values are used in other languages.
> 
> The rules for writing a symbol are exactly the same as the rules for
> writing an identifier; see sections on identifiers
> and symbols.
> 
> It is guaranteed that any symbol that has been returned as part of
> a literal expression, or read using the `read` procedure, and
> subsequently written out using the `write` procedure, will read back
> in as the identical symbol (in the sense of `eqv?`).
> 
> **Note**:  Some implementations have values known as __uninterned symbols__,
> which defeat write/read invariance, and also violate the rule that two
> symbols are the same if and only if their names are spelled the same.
> This report does not specify the behavior of
> implementation-dependent extensions.
