#### Description

> Some sections contained within this document were sourced (almost verbatim) from the
> __Revised-7th Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme__
> (which we shall call the "original document" or "original text").
> 
> Therefore we would like to acknowledge the original document authors, and thank them for their efforts
> both in the standardization effort, and the editing of the original document.
> 
> The original document authors are listed in the ["Authors"](../../r7rs/appendices/authors.md#appendix__r7rs__authors) appendix;
> moreover other individuals that have helped in the creation of the original document are listed in the
> ["Acknowledgments"](../../r7rs/appendices/acknowledgments.md#appendix__r7rs__acknowledgments) appendix.

>   * the actual "original" document (from 6th July 2013):
>     * [https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs/rnrs/r7rs-official.pdf](https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs/src/4c27517de187142ad2cf4bcd8cb9199ae1e48c09/rnrs/r7rs-official.pdf);

>     * whose MD5 fingerprint is `4b3dfe90422a410abd2137ea983594cf`;

>     * whose MD5 fingerprint is `c4d1f283483cd5d1c2cf86dda35b6ac8`;
> 
>   * a second "recompiled" variant (made by the authors of this Scheme implementation, based from the same LaTeX sources as the "original"):
>     * [https://github.com/volution/vonuvoli-scheme/documentation/external/r7rs-small-spec/recompiled.pdf](https://github.com/volution/vonuvoli-scheme/blob/4f62084aeeca2071c52b50220ba7f81dddc4b911/documentation/external/r7rs-small-spec/recompiled.pdf);

> 
> These text adapted as follows:
> 
>   * the original text used LaTeX, and thus was converted to CommonMark (mainly via regular expressions replacements and manual editing);
> 
>   * the "internal" references (i.e. pointing inside that document) were replaced with "textual" descriptions;
>   (for example `see section 3.5` was replaced with `see section on proper tail recursion`;)
> 
>   * most of the "external" references or citations were replaced with links of the form [[citation]](#),
>   which for the moment are "broken";  some other references were transformed
>   into emphasised text of the form __Some Standard__;  meanwhile other references were completely removed;
> 
>   * the original text was split into smaller chunks and placed within this document where needed;
>   thus although this document contains almost all of the original text, it does so in an "unordered" manner;
>

> 
> This usage (and adaptation) of the original text is explicitly allowed by the original authors,
