# Lexical conventions

#### Description

> This section gives an informal account of some of the lexical
> conventions used in writing Scheme programs.  For a formal syntax of
> Scheme, see section on formal syntax.
> 
> 
> ##### Identifiers
> 
> An identifier is any sequence of letters, digits, and
> "extended identifier characters" provided that it does not have a prefix
> which is a valid number.
> However, the  `.` token (a single period) used in the list syntax
> is not an identifier.
> 
> All implementations of Scheme must support the following extended identifier
> characters:
> 
> ````
> ! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @ ^ _ ~
> ````
> 
> Alternatively, an identifier can be represented by a sequence of zero or more
> characters enclosed within vertical lines (`|`), analogous to
> string literals.  Any character, including whitespace characters, but
> excluding the backslash and vertical line characters,
> can appear verbatim in such an identifier.
> In addition, characters can be
> specified using either an `<inline hex escape>` or
> the same escapes
> available in strings.
> 
> For example, the
> identifier `|H\x65;llo|` is the same identifier as
> |Hello|, and in an implementation that supports the appropriate
> Unicode character the identifier `|\x3BB;|` is the same as the
> identifier `lambda`.
> What is more, `|\t\t|` and `|\x9;\x9;|` are the
> same.
> Note that `||` is a valid identifier that is different from any other
> identifier.
> 
> Here are some examples of identifiers:
> 
> ````
> ...                      +
> +soup+                   <=?
> ->string                 a34kTMNs
> lambda                   list->vector
> q                        V17a
> |two words|              |two\x20;words|
> the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings
> ````
> 
> See section on lexical structure for the formal syntax of identifiers.
> 
> Identifiers have two uses within Scheme programs:
> 
>   * Any identifier can be used as a variable
>  or as a syntactic keyword
> (see section on variables, syntactic keywords and regions, and see section on macros).
> 
>   * When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal
> (see section on `quote`), it is being used to denote a __symbol__
> (see section on symbols).
> 
> In contrast with earlier revisions of the report [R5RS](#links), the
> syntax distinguishes between upper and lower case in
> identifiers and in characters specified using their names.  However, it
> does not distinguish between upper and lower case in numbers,
> nor in `<inline hex escapes>` used
> in the syntax of identifiers, characters, or strings.
> None of the identifiers defined in this report contain upper-case
> characters, even when they appear to do so as a result
> of the English-language convention of capitalizing the first word of
> a sentence.
> 
> The following directives give explicit control over case
> folding.
> 
> ````
> #!fold-case
> #!no-fold-case
> ````
> 
> These directives can appear anywhere comments are permitted (see
> section on whitespace and comments) but must be followed by a delimiter.
> They are treated as comments, except that they affect the reading
> of subsequent data from the same port. The `#!fold-case` directive causes
> subsequent identifiers and character names to be case-folded
> as if by `string-foldcase` (see section on strings).
> It has no effect on character
> literals.  The `#!no-fold-case` directive
> causes a return to the default, non-folding behavior.
> 
> 
> ##### Whitespace and comments
> 
> __Whitespace__ characters include the space, tab, and newline characters.
> (Implementations may provide additional whitespace characters such
> as page break.)  Whitespace is used for improved readability and
> as necessary to separate tokens from each other, a token being an
> indivisible lexical unit such as an identifier or number, but is
> otherwise insignificant.  Whitespace can occur between any two tokens,
> but not within a token.  Whitespace occurring inside a string
> or inside a symbol delimited by vertical lines
> is significant.
> 
> The lexical syntax includes several comment forms.
> Comments are treated exactly like whitespace.
> 
> A semicolon (`;`) indicates the start of a line
> comment.  The comment continues to the
> end of the line on which the semicolon appears.
> 
> Another way to indicate a comment is to prefix a `<datum>`
> (cf. section on external representations) with `#;` and optional
> `<whitespace>`.  The comment consists of
> the comment prefix `#;`, the space, and the `<datum>` together.  This
> notation is useful for "commenting out" sections of code.
> 
> Block comments are indicated with properly nested
> `#|` and `|#` pairs.
> 
> ````
> #|
>    The FACT procedure computes the factorial
>    of a non-negative integer.
> |#
> (define fact
>   (lambda (n)
>     (if (= n 0)
>         #;(= n 1)
>         1        ;Base case: return 1
>         (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
> ````
> 
> 
> ##### Other notations
> 
> For a description of the notations used for numbers, see
> section on numbers.
> 
> * `.` `+` `-` --
> These are used in numbers, and can also occur anywhere in an identifier.
> A delimited plus or minus sign by itself
> is also an identifier.
> A delimited period (not occurring within a number or identifier) is used
> in the notation for pairs (section on pairs and lists), and to indicate a
> rest-parameter in a formal parameter list (section on `lambda`).
> Note that a sequence of two or more periods __is__ an identifier.
> 
> * `(` `)` --
> Parentheses are used for grouping and to notate lists
> (section on pairs and lists).
> 
> * `'` --
> The apostrophe (single quote) character is used to indicate literal data (section on `quote`).
> 
> * `â€™` --
> The grave accent (backquote) character is used to indicate partly constant
> data (section on `quasiquote`).
> 
> * `,` `,@` --
> The character comma and the sequence comma at-sign are used in conjunction
> with quasiquotation (section on `quasiquote`).
> 
> * `"` --
> The quotation mark character is used to delimit strings (section on strings).
> 
> * `\` --
> Backslash is used in the syntax for character constants
> (section on characters) and as an escape character within string
> constants (section on strings) and identifiers
> (section on lexical structure).
> 
> * `[` `]` `{` `}` --
> Left and right square and curly brackets (braces)
> are reserved for possible future extensions to the language.
> 
> * `#` --
> The number sign is used for a variety of purposes depending on
> the character that immediately follows it:
> 
> * `#t` `#f` --
> These are the boolean constants (section on booleans),
> along with the alternatives `#true` and `#false`.
> 
> * `#\` --
> This introduces a character constant (section on characters).
> 
> * `#(` --
> This introduces a vector constant (section on vectors).  Vector constants
> are terminated by `)`.
> 
> * `#u8(` --
> This introduces a bytevector constant (section on byte-vectors).  Bytevector constants
> are terminated by `)`.
> 
> * `#e` `#i` `#b` `#o` `#d` `#x` --
> These are used in the notation for numbers (section on syntax of numerical constants).
> 
> * `#<n>=` `#<n>#` --
> These are used for labeling and referencing other literal data (section on datum labels).
> 
> 
> ##### Datum labels
> 
> ````
> #<n>=<datum>    lexical syntax
> #<n>#           lexical syntax
> ````
> 
> The lexical syntax
> `#<n>=<datum>` reads the same as `<datum>`, but also
> results in `<datum>` being labelled by `<n>`.
> It is an error if `<n>` is not a sequence of digits.
> 
> The lexical syntax `#<n>#` serves as a reference to some
> object labelled by `#<n>=`; the result is the same
> object as the `#<n>`=
> (see section on equivalence predicates).
> 
> Together, these syntaxes permit the notation of
> structures with shared or circular substructure.
> 
> ````
> (let ((x (list 'a 'b 'c)))
>   (set-cdr! (cddr x) x)
>   x)                       ===> #0=(a b c . #0#)
> ````
> 
> The scope of a datum label is the portion of the outermost datum in which it appears
> that is to the right of the label.
> Consequently, a reference `#<n>#` can occur only after a label
> `#<n>=`; it is an error to attempt a forward reference.  In
> addition, it is an error if the reference appears as the labelled object itself
> (as in `#<n>= #<n>#`),
> because the object labelled by `#<n>=` is not well
> defined in this case.
> 
> It is an error for a `<program>` or `<library>` to include
> circular references except in literals.  In particular,
> it is an error for `quasiquote` (section `quasiquote`) to contain them.
> 
> ````
> #1=(begin (display #\x) #1#)
>                        ===> #error
