#### Description

> Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
> feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
> features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very small number
> of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are
> composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language
> that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming
> paradigms in use today.
> 
> Scheme
> was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first-class
> procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the usefulness of
> static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically typed language.
> Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures
> from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lexical
> environment for all variables, and to evaluate the operator position
> of a procedure call in the same way as an operand position.  By relying
> entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme emphasized the
> fact that tail-recursive procedure calls are essentially GOTOs that
> pass arguments, thus allowing a programming style that is both coherent
> and efficient.  Scheme was the first widely used programming language to
> embrace first-class escape procedures, from which all previously known
> sequential control structures can be synthesized.  A subsequent
> version of Scheme introduced the concept of exact and inexact numbers,
> an extension of Common Lisp's generic arithmetic.
> More recently, Scheme became the first programming language to support
> hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a block-structured language
> to be extended in a consistent and reliable manner.
