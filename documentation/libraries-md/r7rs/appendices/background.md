#### Description

> The first description of Scheme was written in
> 1975 [[Scheme75]](#errors).  A revised report [[Scheme78]](#errors)
> appeared in 1978, which described the evolution
> of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded to support an
> innovative compiler [[Rabbit]](#errors).  Three distinct projects began in
> 1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and
> Indiana University [[Rees82]](#errors), [[MITScheme]](#errors), [[Scheme311]](#errors).  An introductory
> computer science textbook using Scheme was published in
> 1984 [[SICP]](#errors).
> 
> As Scheme became more widespread,
> local dialects began to diverge until students and researchers
> occasionally found it difficult to understand code written at other
> sites.
> Fifteen representatives of the major implementations of Scheme therefore
> met in October 1984 to work toward a better and more widely accepted
> standard for Scheme.
> Their report, the RRRS [[RRRS]](#errors),
> was published at MIT and Indiana University in the summer of 1985.
> Further revision took place in the spring of 1986, resulting in the
> __R3RS__ [[R3RS]](#errors).
> Work in the spring of 1988 resulted in __R4RS__ [[R4RS]](#errors),
> which became the basis for the
> IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language in 1991 [[IEEEScheme]](#errors).
> In 1998, several additions to the IEEE standard, including high-level
> hygienic macros, multiple return values, and `eval`, were finalized
> as the __R5RS__ [[R5RS]](#errors).
> 
> In the fall of 2006, work began on a more ambitious standard,
> including many new improvements and stricter requirements made in the
> interest of improved portability.  The resulting standard, the
> __R6RS__, was completed in August 2007 [[R6RS]](#errors), and was organized
> as a core language and set of mandatory standard libraries.
> Several new implementations of Scheme conforming to it were created.
> However, most existing __R5RS__ implementations (even excluding those
> which are essentially unmaintained) did not adopt __R6RS__, or adopted
> only selected parts of it.
> 
> In consequence, the Scheme Steering Committee decided in August 2009 to divide the
> standard into two separate but compatible languages --- a "small"
> language, suitable for educators, researchers, and users of embedded languages,
> focused on __R5RS__ compatibility, and a "large" language focused
> on the practical needs of mainstream software development,
> intended to become a replacement for __R6RS__.
> The present report describes the "small" language of that effort:
> therefore it cannot be considered in isolation as the successor
> to __R6RS__.
